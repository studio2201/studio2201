# studio2201 Architectural Design

**studio2201** is a specialized digital foundry focused on experimental web experiences. Rather than building massive, monolithic game engines, the organization is dedicated to building hyper-focused, single-purpose interactive containers.

## 1. The "9x9" Vision (9 Tools, 9 Games)

The core architecture of studio2201 revolves around the "9x9" paradigm. The organization will consist of exactly **9 Web-Based Tools** and **9 Web-Based Games**.
*   **Hyper-Focused Scope**: Each repository does exactly one thing and does it flawlessly. There is no feature creep.
*   **Web-Native Containers**: Every tool and game is packaged as a standalone, ultra-lightweight web container (Docker/Podman) that can be spun up in milliseconds.

## 2. Copyright Safety & Clean Room Design

Due to past issues with upstream copyright claims, studio2201 enforces a strict **Clean Room Design** policy.
*   **No Code Copying**: We do not fork, clone, or heavily borrow from existing open-source game engines or toolsets. Every line of logic is written from first principles.
*   **Sovereign Assets**: All visual assets, physics engines, and state synchronization algorithms are developed in-house to guarantee 100% intellectual property ownership.

## 3. Technology Stack

While the tools and games are simple in scope, they are built on modern, highly performant web primitives:
*   **WASM & WebGL**: Leveraging modern browser APIs for smooth, 60fps rendering without requiring heavy desktop installations.
*   **OpenOODA Synergy**: Where multiplayer state synchronization is required, the games will utilize lightweight OpenOODA CRDT patterns to ensure deterministic state across clients.

## 4. Governance

*   studio2201 strictly follows the organization's global governance rules (`RULES.md`, `SWARM.md`, `PROBE.md`) managed in the meta-repository. 
*   All development cycles follow the strict `OODA.md` iteration loop to ensure clean, provable code generation that avoids copyright entanglement.
