# Rules (any repo)

**Location:** `~/RULES.md`  
**Scope:** Any codebase.  
**Purpose:** Always-on **first principles** of how we work. Not product scripts. Not DESIGN.

**Siblings:** `~/OODA.md` (rotation) · `~/PROBE.md` (assumption hunt).  
**Product docs** (`ROOT/DESIGN.md`, `ROOT/TOOLS.md`) are **inputs** — they never replace this file.

## 0. Where things run

| Axiom (here) | Executed in |
|--------------|-------------|
| Hygiene requirements | **OODA Lock** (every ship); **PROBE** when security-shaped |
| Security posture | **Always** in Act; **PROBE** to falsify |
| First principles + planning | **OODA Observe / Decide** |
| E-M | **OODA** every turn |
| Reverse entropy | **OODA Ship** report; **PROBE** claim pack |
| Line pressure | **OODA Lock**; **PROBE** E-pack |
| Immune tests | **OODA Act**; **PROBE** rejects synthetic rails |

## 1. Core axioms (non-negotiable)

### 1.1 First principles
- Prefer root causes and mechanisms over slogans and checklist theater.  
- If a claim is not grounded in behavior + evidence, treat it as untested (\(U\)).  
- **Plan just enough** to act: clear goal, constraints, and done-bar — then implement. Planning without Act violates E-M.

### 1.2 E-M (energy / act)
Every turn: **rank**, then **implement** or record an explicit fail-closed residual.  
No observe-only theater. No “we should someday” without a backlog entry or residual note.

### 1.3 Honesty / fail-closed
Unfinished work fails closed or is named residual.  
No soft-pass, no silent OK, no fake “done.”

### 1.4 Security (default posture)
- Prefer **default-deny** for privileged effects (auth, caps, secrets, network, exec).  
- Privileges must be **explicit** on the product path (params, tokens, roles) — not ambient accident.  
- Do not claim security stronger than rails prove.  
- Secrets stay out of logs, fixed world-readable temps, and commits.  
- **PROBE** is how we challenge security claims; axioms are the bar.

### 1.5 Reverse entropy
The **trust surface** should get cleaner over time, not dirtier.  
Prefer ships that **lower** disorder \(S\) (or hold \(S\) with an honest one-line why).  
Raising \(S\) (new untested claims, fail-open holes, hand-waves, oversize) is a bad ship unless the residual is explicit.

### 1.6 Immune tests
Behavior that is claimed ships with **pass and fail** proof where it matters.  
Green happy-path only is not immunity.

### 1.7 Hygiene (required)
Hygiene is an **axiom**, not optional polish. Minimum bar before Ship (OODA Lock):

| Check | Intent |
|-------|--------|
| **Line pressure** | Owned sources ≤ **256** lines (or repo lock); split at functional seams |
| **No cruft** | No debug dumps, accidental binaries, `__pycache__`, or “pointless pointer” docs in the tree |
| **Secrets** | No credentials/tokens in source or commit |
| **Temps** | Build/run temps cleaned on success **and** failure (traps / equivalent) |
| **Git** | No force-push of shared main unless owner policy; don’t commit secrets or generated trash |
| **Claims match tree** | Docs don’t assert features the code doesn’t have (or residual is named) |

Product may add hygiene scripts in `ROOT/TOOLS.md` or CI; absence of a script does **not** waive the axiom.

### 1.8 Short feedback
Prefer small changes that produce a **true** pass/fail signal quickly.

### 1.9 Zero Trust Agency
Never trust summaries, commit messages, or "task complete" claims from peer agents (or yourself) without independently verifying the actual code.
A "green CI" is only as trustworthy as its test coverage for the specific module modified. Always verify that security constraints (e.g., capability checks, budget decrements) were not silently bypassed to force a "happy path" success.

## 2. Heuristics (support the axioms)

| Name | Rule |
|------|------|
| **Power law** | Decide at most **5** items this turn; ignore the long tail. |
| **Line pressure** | Default **≤256** lines / owned file (or repo lock). |
| **Entropy \(S\)** (optional score) | \(S = U + F + W + O\) |

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **\(U\)** | Untested claims |
| **\(F\)** | Fail-open / silent OK |
| **\(W\)** | Hand-waves (stub as done) |
| **\(O\)** | Oversize owned files |

Report when used: `S: n (Δ …) — U=_ F=_ W=_ O=_`  
Repos may extend \(S\) in **ROOT/TOOLS.md** (product-only terms).

---

## 3. Science as *source* (motivation, not a catalog)

| Domain | Idea | Axiom / place |
|--------|------|----------------|
| Control / OODA | Short loops | OODA.md |
| Flight / energy | Act, don’t only plan | E-M |
| Thermo | Trust-surface disorder | Reverse entropy / \(S\) |
| Pareto / math | Few items dominate | Power law ≤5 |
| Biology | Attack *and* defend | Immune tests |
| Chemistry | No fake purity | Fail-closed |
| Materials | Complexity limits | Line pressure / hygiene |

---

## 4. Using product docs (combine, don’t replace)

| Input | Role |
|-------|------|
| **`ROOT/DESIGN.md`** | What this product is. Don’t edit DESIGN for fake victory. |
| **Backlog** | What to build after red rails / honesty. |
| **`ROOT/PROGRESS.md`** | Handoff; update on Ship. |
| **`ROOT/TOOLS.md`** | Product-only metrics/scripts — **additional** constraints. |
| **Rails / CI** | Lock suspects; PROBE still challenges claims. |

---

## 5. Ranking (default Decide order)

1. Red product rails / regressions  
2. Honesty / security fail-open holes  
3. Next backlog item (DESIGN-aligned)  
4. DESIGN gap → backlog, then do  
5. Entropy / hygiene / split only if blocking or cheap  

---

## 6. Non-goals

No language mandating, no product binary lists, no smoke inventories. Those are **ROOT** docs.
